## Game concept
An action roguelike game utilizing the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons for a more interractive experience. A rarely seen combination. The player has to take a more active role in defeating the enemies by using the built-in motion sensors of the Joy-Cons itself. The game is both immersive and rewarding at the same time!
