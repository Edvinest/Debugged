# Debugged
Joint project for a Software Design class.

## Game concept
An action roguelike game utilizing the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons for a more interractive experience. A rarely seen combination. The player has to take a more active role in defeating the enemies by using the built-in motion sensors of the Joy-Cons itself. The game is both immersive and rewarding at the same time!

## Game description

Debugged is a 3D rogue-like action game inspired by Vampire Survivor and many other games similar to it. The player gets attacked by giant bugs and has to fend them off wave by wave. After each wave the player gets awarded with upgrade cards. While they give upgrades to the player, almost all of them have some drawbacks. After every fifth round a boss appears which deals more damage then the rest and has way more health then a default enemy. If the player can complete enough waves, a portal appears, which, when entered teleports the player to another level with more difficult enemies but higher scores. The player isn't forced to enter the portal when it appears. They can keep on doing the waves until they get bored, or feel strong enough to continue.

When the player inevitably loses, their highscore gets uploaded to a database, which in turn allows the player to see a leaderboard in the main menu, encouraging competition between player to see who can get the biggest highscore in the least amount of time.
